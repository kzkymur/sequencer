# Sequencer

## About

- This is a Headless TypeScript Library project with Vite and Vitest.
- `Sequencer` is the name of this project.
- Users can do these things
    1. Make fragments.
        - Each fragments are constructed with these properties.
            1. name
            2. duration [ milisec ]
            3. callback function
    2. Construct sequencer by arranging fragments.
        - Sequencer is contructed with
            1. array of fragments
            2. pitch [ milisec ]
            3. loop flag
        - Sequencer has timerWorker.
        - Also total time to play all fragments in sequencer is known.
    3. Play, stop, replay sequencer.
        - While sequencer played, timerWorker calculate current_time by pitch time, sequencer detect specific fragment from passed time and fragments's duration information, and exec its callback function.
        - if loop flag is true, sequencer will restart from top fragment when it go over.
    4. Edit sequencer and fragments.
        - Users can edit components at anytime

## Architecture

- This library is constructed only a few files.

### `main.ts`

- Here is entry point in build process.
- export Sequencer object.

### `fragments.ts`

- Fragment Object
    - Constructor function recieve these propeties and make unique `id` (string)
        1. `name`
            - requied
        2. `duration` [ milisec ]
            - requied
        3. `callback`
            - optional
            - Unset make it do nothing fragment as sleep function.
    - That all properties have each methods to change itself.
    - `copy(): Fragment` method
        - return the copy instance of itself
        - All difference is unique `id`

### `sequencer.ts`

- Sequencer Object
    - Constructor function receive only `pitch` and `loop_frag` properties. They are requied and of course have each methods to change itself.
    - Sequencer have a Fragment Array, `fragments`. It is empty when instance created.
    - Each sequencer have each timeWorker instance.
    - `push(fragment: Fragment)` method
        - Push argument fragment into `fragments`.
        - Throw error if it is already in `fragments`.
    - `remove(fragment: Fragment)` method
        - Remove fragment that have same id as argument fragment from `fragments`.
    - `play(delay: number = 0)` method
        - Play timerWorker and add eventListener with `this.exec` method after the time for `delay` has passed.
        - Throw error if it have been already played
    - `stop(delay: number = 0)` method
        - Stop timerWorker and remove eventListener method after the time for `delay` has passed.
        - Throw error if it's not played
    - `private exec(current_time: number)` method
        - Detect specific fragment from `fragments` by `current_time` and exec its callback function.

### `timerWorker.ts`

- TimerWorker Object
    - Constructor function receive only `total_time`, `pitch` and `loop_frag` properties. They are requied and of course have each methods to change itself.
    - `private exec()` method
        - culculate `current_time` by `current_time += pitch`
        - dispatch event to sequencer with `current_time` calculated.
        - if loop flag is true, `current_time /= total_time` when it go over `total_time`.
        - else, exec `this.stop()` when it go over `total_time`.
    - `play(delay: number = 0)` method
        - do `setInterval` function with `this.exec` and `pitch` after the time for `delay` has passed.
    - `stop(delay: number = 0)` method
        - do clearInterval after the time for `delay` has passed.

### `const.ts`

- This files have const strings and numbers.
- For example, the name of event name.

## Test

- Each files and functions have test file.
- All test codes are written in `test` directory and work with Vitest.
- Coverage is always higher than 90%.

## Example

- `example/index.html` file allows users to try this library's features written in About section in this `.clinerules`.
